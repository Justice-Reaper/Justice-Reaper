# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hey there! I'm Sergio, a 23-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast. I’ve always been passionate about technology, so much so that three years ago I decided to make it my career. I started by earning an associate’s degree in Multiplatform Application Development (MAD), where I developed multiple desktop applications using Java and mobile apps with Kotlin

After that, I specialized in pentesting as I found it the most fulfilling area of cybersecurity. Moreover, I also run a personal blog where I publish write-ups and technical articles about PortSwigger labs and HackTheBox machines. So far, I have published over 230 articles while maintaining a regular posting schedule. I am doing this while preparing for my OSCP and BSCP certifications 

Throughout my journey in this field, I’ve encountered tasks that I found tedious or repetitive. To solve this, I've developed some tools using Bash and Python to automate these processes, allowing me to focus on what truly matters

When it comes to languages, I regard English as essential in this field. That’s why I earned my Cambridge B1 certificate last year, and I’m now working toward my B2 exam
