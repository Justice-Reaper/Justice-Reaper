# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hey there! I'm Sergio, a 23-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast. I've always loved tech, but it wasn't until three years ago that I decided to turn it into a career. My journey started with an associate degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), where I built desktop apps with Java and mobile apps with Kotlin

Later, I shifted my focus to pentesting because it's the most exciting part of cybersecurity for me. I run a personal blog where I share write-ups on PortSwigger labs and Hack The Box machines. To date, I've published over 230 articles and I continue to post regularly as I prepare for the OSCP and BSCP certifications

Along the way, I've automated repetitive tasks using Bash and Python to streamline my workflow and focus on what really matters

As for languages, I believe English is essential in this field, so last year I earned my Cambridge B1 certification and I am now working toward my B2
