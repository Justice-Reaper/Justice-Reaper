# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hey there! I'm Sergio, a 23-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast. I've always been passionate about technology, although I only decided to make it my career three years ago. I started by earning an associate degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), where I developed desktop applications using Java and mobile apps with Kotlin

Later, I specialized in pentesting because I find it the most exciting area of cybersecurity. I run a personal blog where I publish write-ups and technical articles about PortSwigger labs and HackTheBox machines. To date, I've published over 230 articles and maintain a regular posting schedule as I prepare for my OSCP and BSCP certifications

Working in this field, I've encountered some repetitive tasks, which led me to develop automation tools using Bash and Python. These tools help streamline my workflow, allowing me to focus on more important challenges

I strongly believe that English is essential in this industry. I earned my Cambridge B1 certification last year and I'm currently working toward my B2
